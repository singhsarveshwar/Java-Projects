Java first assignment
You will be implementing a simplified school simulation. Make the code as good quality as you can. Follow the Java conventions when it comes to styling/formatting your code (correct indentation, standard capitalization in names, etc.) and other best practices (proper encapsulation, closing all opened files, etc.).

Create the school.subject.SubjectType enumeration type with the following values: HUMANITY and SCIENCE.

Create the school.subject.Subject enumeration type with the following values: LITERATURE, HISTORY, PHYSICS, and CHEMISTRY. Its subjectType field stores the category of the subject (the first two are HUMANITY, the second two are SCIENCE), and the startingYear field stores the grade where the subject is first taught (its value is 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively). Also create standard getter methods for the fields.

The constructor of the school.schedule.Schedule receives a file name. If the file name doesn't start with the schedule character sequence, throw an IllegalArgumentException. Otherwise, you may assume (without manually checking) that the file exists and its formatted as described below. The constructor wil read in the subjects and store them appropriately.

The first line contains a single number: how many classes there are daily.
There is school 5 days a week.
Each day has the same number of classes.
The remaining lines each contain a single Subject in a text representation.
Monday's classes come first, then Tuesday's classes follow and so on.
Hint: you may use the valueOf method of enum types.
Some lines may be empty; ignore those.
If there aren't enough lines to fill each day with classes, throw an IllegalStateException.
The Schedule class has three additional methods:

getClassesPerDay(): self-explanatory.
get(dayN, classN): returns the Subject that is held at the specified time. The days and classes are counted from one, so for example the parameters to query Tuesday's first class are: (2, 1).
isSuitableForYear(grade): returns whether the specified grade is at least as much as the startingYear value of each subject in the schedule.
Create the school.test.SchoolTest class to contain JUnit 5 tests for the application.

Create a beforeEach method in this class (annotated with @BeforeEach) that fills the schedules array's four elements using the scheduleX.txt files where X is 4, 5, 6, and 7. The array elements' type is Subject.
The file named scheduleX.txt must be suitable for grade X and must contain X classes per day.
Write test cases in the following methods. The test cases should be parameterized when necessary.
classesPerDay: all 4 loaded schedules' getClassesPerDay method returns the correct value
scheduledClassType: for all 4 loaded schedules validate that at least one subject (on a given day at a given time) has the correct category (SubjectType)
For example, you can check whether the seventh-graders' subject on Friday in the seventh time slot has the SCIENCE category.
suitable: all 4 loaded schedules return true when isSuitableForYear is called with the appropriate grade
notSuitable: the last 3 schedules (the ones for fifth-graders, sixth-graders and seventh-graders) return false when isSuitableForYear is called with the grade that is one less than the grade the schedule is for (e.g. the fifth-graders' schedule is not suitable for fourth-graders)
invalidName: calling Schedule's constructor with the abcdefg.txt file name causes an IllegalArgumentException to occur
shortContent: calling Schedule's constructor with the scheduleShort.txt file name causes an IllegalStateException to occur, where the scheduleShort.txt is a file with a single line, whose content is just the character 1.
As you will be executing your program using JUnit, you needn't write a main method.
